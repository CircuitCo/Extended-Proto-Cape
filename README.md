Extended-Proto-Cape
===================

The Extended Proto Cape provides more prototyping area for the BeagleBone Black. Users can still have access to the extra areas on each side of the BeagleBone Black's expansion headers even when another cape is stacked. Signals from the expansion headers are also broken out to edges of the PCB.
